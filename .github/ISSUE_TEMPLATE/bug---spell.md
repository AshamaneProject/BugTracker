3. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Criticality**
 [ ] Breaking class : The class/spec isn't playable without this spell fixed. (Taunt for a tank, Mage's Fireball doing 0 damage, ...)
 [ ] High : This bug has a major impact on the spec dps/hps/survivability (Rogue Energy regenerate 50% slower than it should)
 [ ] Medium : End content is doable but harder than is should (20% less damage, ...)
 [ ] Low : Mostly visual (Warrior whirlwind does the damage but the character isn't rotating)
